Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  Airgead Banking App hired Chada Tech to develop an application to allow their users to see how their investments will grow over time.
  Pseudocode or a flowchart was required for this project in order to outline the project.

What did you do particularly well?
  I did a good job with my inline comments along with the user interface. I loved developing a small user interface.
  I thought it was so cool to interact with the program and to be able to use it on my own investments.
  Additionally, the generation of the two reports was awesome to see.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  I believe that this project could be more interactive.
  I would think that using an addtional language could allow for a user to click through menus rather than inputting a number that represents a menu option.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
  I did not run into many challenges with this project. Creating a flowchart prior to development made the process smooth.
  As much as I hate creating flowcharts and pseudocode - when I do them, the project is easy. When I don't do them, the project is much harder.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
  This project was my first big OOP project. I believe that getting better at defining and using classes will help me with future course work.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  Using inline comments helped make this program readable.
  Defining classes and function has made this program more adaptable. The functions are kept at a minimum since they are only called where they are used.
